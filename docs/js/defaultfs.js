            'You-Need-a-3D-Printer.txt':`In 2019, if you're a maker without a 3D printer, you're really missing out. 3D printing is no longer an experimental technology and owning one is as necessary as owning power tools. 3D printers over the past few years has dropped dramatically in price. Filament advancements have allowed the use of 3D printing for a whole new range of items. Finally, 3D printing will save you precious prototyping time, allowing you to iterate much faster, leading to a better project. 
                The price of 3D printers over the past few years have fallen considerably. A few years ago a decent 3-D printer would cost you upwards of $1000, but now with more technological advancements, prices have fallen considerably. Now, you can purchase a very good fully assembled Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer for about $300. According to website 3D Hubs, FDM printing is when, “an object is built by selectively depositing melted material in a predetermined path layer-by-layer.” Even more shocking is the price drop associated with Stereolithography (SLA) printing. “ In SLA, an object is created by selectively curing a polymer resin layer-by-layer using an ultraviolet (UV) laser beam. The materials used in SLA are photosensitive thermoset polymers that come in a liquid form”(3D Hubs). By using this technique, much more precise and intricate parts can be printed than with an FDM method. Just a few years ago you could pay upwards of $10,000 to be an early adopter of a SLA printer. Now the top of the line SLA printer, the Form 3, costs $3,500 with mid tier printers costing $1000. No matter the type of printer you buy today,  they can outperform the multi thousand printers of yesteryear.
            One of the relatively new advancements in 3D printing is the advent of new printing materials. Before the material revolution, your only real choice of material was polylactic acid plastic (PLA) or Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS). While you could get very detailed prints with both of these materials, they are not the best to create high strain parts. Now you are able to print nylon, carbon infused PLA, and Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). While these materials are usually a little more costly and harder to print, they will produce much stronger and longer lasting parts. Airwolf 3D, a 3D printer manufacturer, actually uses 3D printed nylon gears inside their printers because of the incredible durability and reliability that 3D printed nylon offers. In one of the videos on their YouTube channel, they show a comparison between PLA, ABS and Nylon which shows a nylon hook lifting over 400 kilograms of weight while the PLA and ABS could not even lift 200 kilos.
                One of the biggest allures of 3D printing is the rapid prototyping it allows. As a maker we often design one offs that are never meant for production. Being able to design complicated parts and have them in your hand in just a few hours is an unparalleled feeling. Once a printer is set up properly, it becomes just like a paper printer, press a button and sit back and watch. This cuts down on the significant amount of time it would take if you manually made the part any other way. On top of this, most filaments will run you between twenty to thirty dollars per kilogram. 
                One of the uses for this new 3D printing technology is drone racing.  Racing drones are often crashed at high speed meaning parts need to be durable. TPU possesses a high yield strength which is “the stress at which a predetermined amount of permanent deformation occurs.”(Engineers Edge). Drone racers use this fact to their advantage and print TPU pods or coverings that can go on top of their drones. These pods absorb the impact of a crash, saving the drone’s expensive electronics from damage. 
            Many might make the argument that it isn’t worth getting a 3D printer because you will just spend all your time working and fixing your printer. This stereotype is mostly driven by Youtube and the numerous channels dedicated to tinkering with 3D printing. The channels are more about 3D printing as a hobby, trying out all different filaments and settings, than about using them for a practical application. This is a very disproportionate representation of the community because most 3D printer owners use it as a tool instead of a hobby. Through some trial and error, I have been able to set up my own 3D printer to be extremely reliable, with practically no maintenance. One tip I would give to anybody getting into 3D printing is to get a printer that has an auto level feature or to get a printer in which you can install your own auto level sensor. Print quality depends heavily on having a very level print bed. Overtime, the print bed gains tilt, which decreases print quality and can even lead to the print head crashing into the bed. While it is possible to fix this manually, it becomes very tedious to check every few prints.With auto level, the printer will adjust to the inconsistencies of the bed automatically while printing. This not only decreases wasted time, but can lead to more consistent and better 3D parts.
                To reiterate, I feel that a 3D printer should be a tool in every maker's toolkit. While in the past they ended up being more work than they were worth, current technology has mitigated almost all of the complications that were associated with 3D printing. The incredible time saving alone is easily worth the cost of the 3D printer. The ability to sit down at your computer, then only thirty minutes to a few hours later be holding your design in your hands, is incredible. Once you get a 3D printer, you will never want to go back.`,
            'TS100-Soldering-Iron-Review.txt':`I was reluctant to buy the TS100 soldering iron for a while. I heard good things about it online and from others I knew through drone racing. However, at sixty dollars, I felt that my current soldering iron did the trick just fine. I preferred to spend that money on my numerous projects. It was not until I borrowed a TS100 at a drone race to fix my broken drone, that I realized how much I was missing out.
            My first soldering iron was a Weller WLC100, a highly regarded hobby iron. I used this for about two years until I could not remove the tip because the screw was heat welded from years of continual use. After my Weller broke, I did not want to spend a lot of money so I bought one of the numerous Chinese clones of the Weller that usually go for ten to fifteen dollars on Amazon. While these irons got the job done, they would take a while to heat up and barely produce enough heat for the soldering. My biggest gripe with the cheap Chinese irons is that the soldering tips wear out really fast. While replacement tips are readily available all over the internet, I ended up spending more money on replacement tips than it would cost to just buy a nice soldering iron.
            The first thing I noticed about the TS100 was how quick it was to heat up. If you power it on twenty four volts, which I highly recommend, the iron will be at 400 degrees celcius in under ten seconds. This is a huge improvement over the previous irons I used which would take a few minutes even off of 120 volt AC Power. In addition to the TS100’s fast heating, the thermal management on the TS100 is excellent. On all previous irons, if I was soldering at a high heat for upwards of an hour, the iron itself would start to get very warm and would be uncomfortable to use. Not so with the TS100. I’ve used the TS100 to solder for 4 hours doing a combination of different high heat tasks to solder printed circuit boards (PCB), and it performed flawlessly through the soldering session.
                One huge plus about the TS100 is the open source nature behind it. You might be thinking why in the world would I care about my soldering iron running open source software. Surprisingly, it is more important than you think. Many people have made custom software for the iron which not only increases the max temperature, provides a more accurate temperature control but also introduces a better button layout. This software is a must have for any TS100 owner because it takes a great soldering iron and makes it nearly perfect.
            My one gripe with the TS100, beyond the $60 price point, came up when I first tried to switch soldering tips. I ordered an after-market bevel tip to use with my TS100 because I prefer using this style tip with the PCB and small wire soldering I typically do. When I attempted to remove the screw that held in the stock tip, it immediately became stripped. Luckily, I was able to remove it, but this is still pretty unacceptable given the fact that I had not even used the iron yet. I solved this issue by replacing the stock original screw with a socket head M2 screw I had lying around. The replacement is almost impossible to strip and since then I have had no issues switching between various soldering tips.
            Don’t just take my word on the TS100, take Louis Rossmann who runs an Apple product repair shop and also has a Youtube Channel of over one million subscribers. Like me, he feels as if the TS100 is a near perfect soldering iron for the price. His current soldering iron is a Hakko FM-203 and is upwards of $400 and he feels that the TS100 holds its own against it. Given all this praise, I think that a TS100 is a must have for any maker or electronic enthusiast that does a decent amount of soldering.`,
            'A-Revolution-of-Flight.txt':`When most people think of drones, they think of large slow drones that get sweeping landscape shots. For Andy Shen, owner of Shendrones, this image could not be further from the truth. Andy designs carbon fiber frames for racing drones, small quadcopters that are usually under one and a half pounds and can travel upwards of a hundred miles-per-hour. While racing drones are much more capable for dynamic video production than larger drones, they require a much more specialized operator and custom design. This is because every small difference will produce a large change in flight characteristics for such a fine tuned drone. That’s where Andy comes in. He designs unique frames that have pushed the boundaries of drone design. 
            Andy, formerly a photographer and part time drone hobbyist, founded Shendrones in 2015. His first commercial endeavor started when his nephews wanted to shoot down his drone with a Nerf gun. “Not wanting to be gunned down, I thought it’d be even cooler to mount [a Nerf gun] on a quad and shoot back,” said Andy. Called the Blast, his frame enabled hobbyist to create drones that flung Nerf discs. While the product was geared towards a small market, a video by Motherboard, a tech news outlet, featuring the Blast garnered over 300,000 views helping move more units. Shortly thereafter, eager to take advantage of the relatively new racing drone industry, Andy decided to try his hand at making frames designed for pure speed and performance. At the time, he was one of a handful of people designing frames for this market and made a name for himself among enthusiasts for always coming up with unique and well engineered frames. Quickly, every drone supplier was selling his frames.
       But as the technology has changed, so has Andy’s business. In the past two years, Andy has pushed the boundaries of industry accepted design principles, making several cinematography platforms that enable racing drones to capture previously unachievable shots, revolutionizing how drones are used in traditional media.
           The first large cinematography revolution that Andy started was the idea of a chase drone made specifically for capturing video. Before this concept, people were just repurposing hobby oriented frames that could accommodate a camera. The problem was that the frames were designed with durability in mind first, and the content creation second. Instead, Andy designed the Ichabod frame which emphasized video quality first. This caused an awkward-looking design which revolved around an innovative camera mount allowing for the flight camera and recording cameras to be at different angles with no propellers in view. This feature was something that no other frame at the time offered and significantly reduced the piloting difficulties experienced with filming drift cars, mountain bikers, snowboarders, and other fast moving subjects. 
       Shortly after, Andy created the Palindrone. Derived from the Ichabod, the Palindrone introduced a dual GoPro setup which allowed a pilot to record in front and behind them. While this frame is very niche, it allows for some incredible previously unachievable shots, on any camera platform, such as a mountain biker going down a trail from a frontal perspective.
       The largest drone cinematography revolution was Andy’s creation of the Cinewhoop. A Cinewhoop is a classification for a small drone that can carry a GoPro and is ducted, which means the propellers are surrounded by plastic tubes. The benefit of this design is that pilots can now fly extremely close to objects and people without a fear of harming them. One video that exemplifies this benefit is a collaboration between Fench Professional Longboarder Lotfi Lamaali and pilot Fincky. This video won a GoPro award for its amazing filming in combination with talent of the longboarder. “It had to be the Squirt. Nothing else could have done it … The video would have not existed without it,” Andy puts it. The shots were too dangerous to use a normal racing drone because of how close Fincky was to Lamaali. 
       Interestingly, Andy posts all his design challenges online for anyone to read. For every frame that comes out, there is a detailed write up showing all the prototypes, failures, and successes that led to the final product. At first, people thought that Andy’s blog was crazy because it teaches people how to do his job. Andy responds to this the same way his photography mentor did. “I could tell you everything I know and you would never shoot like me.” Andy believes this statement is true not only for art, but also for engineering as a whole because of its iterative nature. By reading Andy’s blog, you could become a frame designer yourself with all the valuable information and analysis that is neatly organized in his numerous posts, from drone vibrations and harmonics to aerodynamics and structural analysis. But even with all this information, your designs will be drastically different than Andy’s. A great example of how detailed his blog post are, is a post about finding the optimal drone arm shape.
       I suspect that propwash is so turbulent that normal aero calculations don't apply – just think about how inefficient [propellers] are when they have to fly through their own propwash. To put it another way, I'm guessing that while coefficient of drag (Cd) and frontal area are equally important in clean air, frontal area takes precedence over Cd in dirty air. 
       On top of Andy’s blog being extremely informational, it serves as a form of promotion for his frames. If he can justify his unique design and why it is superior to the countless other frames out there, he can gain a new customer.
           Another reason that Andy blogs is the rampant cloning that happens in the industry. As soon as a new product comes out, factories in China will copy it piece by piece, and be able to produce it at a lower cost. Andy’s frames are no exception to this rule. As soon as the Squirt became more popular, Chinese ripoffs immediately popped up. Andy feels as if his blog, “Lay[s] down the mark, like ‘Hey, by the way, I invented this.’ Without it people will not know if Iflight came first or the Squirt.” 
       While Iflight and many other smaller Chinese companies ripped off Andy’s frames, their products don't reflect the same attention to detail that Andy’s drones do. “It's like they were copied by someone who has never flown one of these drones. The ducts aren’t even flanged,” Andy said, referring to the Squirt’s ducts that protect the subject. For months, he researched the optimal shape for these ducts and published the results on his blog for anyone to read, which makes the fact that the Chinese clones could not copy that right even funnier.
           Moving forward, Andy sees himself continuing to focus on the cinematography side of drone racing. Andy told me that many of his frames start with conversations with pilots and understanding their needs.“Gab, Nurk, Finicky, and Banister have all come to me separately and said they want to fly the Black Magic 4k,” Andy explained, referring to the industry’s top pilots desire to use a mirrorless camera for filming.  Many professional productions will refuse to use the footage from GoPro cameras that are used on most racing drones. However, to achieve this goal, Andy needs to account for the fact that the Black Magic 4K is significantly heavier than a GoPro. Andy hopes that this new drone can help get more racing drone shots on the big screen. Currently, this project is in the early phases of development but a prototype has been built and is currently being tested. 	
       One of Andy’s largest goals is to push racing drones into the mainstream. Racing drones are currently being used mostly to shoot action sports, but their full potential is just starting to get realized. Gab, a professional pilot who works closely with Andy, has pushed the boundaries. For National Geographic, he has used a racing drone to simulate a bird flight, capturing what it's like to zoom between trees. As more professional productions use racing drones, Hollywood may be next. So next time you go to the movies, you may be able to experience the next generation of cinematography, courtesy of a racing drone.`,
            'Nerf-guns-Drones-and-Fire':`When I was five and my brother was four, one of his friends on a playdate asked, “What does your father do for a job.” My brother promptly responded, “He works in the garage.” Although this was not true, our father decided to take some time off work after he lost his job. During this time he spent hours in our garage working on his cars. So when my brother said that my father’s job was in the garage, I didn't even dispute it because to me, that was true. 
            Even before my parents got together, my father was working on, and racing, cars. At the time he had a Mitsubishi Evolution that he modified to become a complete track car. Over the course of the one and a half years he was home, he was able to increase the horsepower from the stock 286 to over 390. This upgrade required the installation of a lot of custom parts. On top of the power modifications he changed out the suspension to make it handle better on the track.
            While my father worked in the garage, I would often watch him. I was infatuated even at a young age, amazed that you could build or modify something if you put your mind to it. My father would explain to my five year old self what the different tools did. He explained how much to torque down a wheel, how to change a brake pad or what a turbocharger was. He didn’t dumb it down for me or treat me like a silent audience. Seeing my father working on his car, and his willingness to explain things to me, gave me the confidence to attempt my own engineering projects.
            When I was eight and my dad was back at work, I loved Nerf guns. In reality, what eight-year-old boy doesn’t love Nerf guns. Regularly, all the neighbors would gather at my house and we would have huge Nerf wars in my oversized, mostly unfurnished basement. We had our own rules and game modes. Being a tech savvy competitive eight-year-old, I found a Youtube video where someone modified a Nerf gun to make it shoot further. To me now, the process to modify a Nerf gun seems elementary, but to eight-year-old me it seemed like a huge challenge. I had only used a screwdriver previously a couple of times, and on top of that, I had to remember how the Nerf gun was assembled. I knew that was going to be a challenge. I debated attempting the modification knowing that there was a good possibility that I would break the Nerf gun. But I was hooked. I needed to have the coolest Nerf gun in the neighborhood. 
            I decided to attempt the modification one afternoon in late winter. Modification of a Nerf gun requires a screwdriver to take apart the blaster, a long Phillips screwdriver, and a hammer. The long screwdriver is stuck down the firing tube and hammered to remove the air restrictor. After searching for an hour, I finally found the screwdriver that fit the screws in the Nerf gun. (I did not dare take one from the garage.) Slowly, I began to take the blaster apart. The only problem was I didn't have a hammer readily at my disposal. I decided to improvise. I took the part I needed to hammer and instead put a screwdriver inside of it and proceeded to slam it against my floor. It took several tries for my weak eight-year-old muscles to do any actual damage. All of a sudden I felt the plastic give way, but instead of hammering out the part I was intending to, I put a hole in the side of the firing chamber. I knew I screwed up, but I still thought as long as I put it back together it would work. That was a lie I told myself. I couldn’t even close the Nerf gun because of the deformed part. So, the result of my first real independent engineering project was a complete failure.
            This didn’t stop me. The bug had bitten me. I fantasized if only I hadn’t put a hole in the firing tube, I would have a working, cooler nerf gun. I imagined using it in the Nerf wars with the neighbors. Looking back, it wasn’t just the cool factor, but also the fact that I knew I could accomplish it.  So, one month later, I tried again with an identical Nerf gun. I probably watched the ten minute Youtube video at least 30 times. I could practically recite it verbatim. I knew though I would not make the same mistake again. This time I asked my father for a hammer and a large flat head screwdriver. He was a little reluctant at first to fork out a hammer to me. I persisted, in the end he caved but was sure to give me a safety talk hoping that it would stop me from accidentally killing myself.
            Now equipped with the correct tools, I attempted the modification again. It wasn't the smoothest. While attempting the modification I heard the video saying, “if you've gone for the hammer and screwdriver method, then put it down into the end with the hole, not the pin, and very carefully, smash it out.” I definitely wasn’t careful, and definenly didn't almost put a hole in the firing tube, the orange plastic turning white from the pressure put on it. But eventually I had the air restrictor hammered out of the firing chamber. I reassembled the Nerf gun with a huge grin on my face. To my delight, it actually still fired and in fact shot almost double the distance. 
            This success gave me confidence to attempt more and more complicated projects. For a while, I stuck to nerf guns but I attempted more complicated modifications. Some included electrical modification which introduced me to soldering. In reality Nerf gun modifications were the perfect engineering project for someone my age. They could be done relatively quickly and had very visible and tangible results. As we grew older we had fewer and fewer nerf wars but for a while I still bought Nerf guns. It stopped being about the fun I had from playing with them but instead the fun I got from taking them apart and learning how they worked culminating me building my own nerf gun (It really wasn’t that good).
            In high school, I was no longer modifying Nerf guns and I was looking for the next thing to sink my teeth into. I saw an article outlining the parts needed to build a drone. I knew nothing about drones, but I remembered the past summer I had a summer camp counselor that told me he built one for a university project. Even though I had none of the skills required to build one and nobody to teach me, I was confident that I could figure it out.
            In all the years of Nerf gun modifications and other engineering projects, which included a lot of robotics, I learned that the internet can teach you anything if you look hard enough. I spent hours on Youtube watching all the videos I could find about building a drone. While almost none of the individual videos or articles applied directly to the drone I was building, I was able to piece together the information I needed.
            Even after taking a lot of time to learn about drones on the internet, I still failed. I mean I failed really hard. One time, I had my drone fall from 300 feet when trying to show it to a few friends. Another time, the arm of the drone caught fire because I incorrectly wired a motor controller. There was one time when my drone lost connection over the ocean and I lost it with a brand new GoPro. But these failures never stopped me. I had already learned from Nerf guns, failure is just a learning opportunity that can make you grow. Funnily enough, I see this same attitude about failure from my father.  When he accidentally breaks something and is cursing because he is going to have to bring it into the shop, it never stops him from picking up the tools the next time. In reality, I don't think engineering would be fun without failure. It allows you to keep working and learning just like I did buying and accidently breaking Nerf guns far past the wars being over.`
